#Kickstarting with Excel

##Overview of Project
For this particular project, we determined the efficacy of Louise's various Kickstarter campaigns. Using the collected data, we determined the overall success of her campaigns based on launch dates and fundraising goals. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was for the class to demonstrate a wide range of Excel skills and knowledge.  We were able to create pivot tables and charts using data we organized through filters and categories, translated through date conversions, and refined through categories and sub categories.

## Analysis and Challenges
Our first analysis was Outcomes based on Launch Date followed by an Analysis of Outcomes based on Goals.  Before beginning either analysis, we created new columns to create the percentage funded and average donation cells.  We used the Round() function while dividing the goal amount by the pledged amount to generate this number.  We utilized the round() function again when determining the average doantion by dividing the donations by the number of backers.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
By seperating the parent categories from their subcategories, we were able to effectively determine how successful a campaign was based on its launch date. In the theater genre specifically, we were able to conclude that May was the most successful month for theater fundraisers based on our data.  All months saw more success than failure wtih May having the largest gap between succes and failure, while December had the smallest. There were very few canceled shows at only 3 per week on average.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
